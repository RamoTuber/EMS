# EMS
email management system - The CMS for bullet proof emails

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Email marketing nowadays has very much advanced, the use of media content and animated gifs as well as inline and internal css is now being accepted by the major browsers. However it is true that many companies would want their email campagns to be cross-client. 
The above is not easily achieved as even one email client, such as Gmail, would show different results whether the email is being viewed on desktop or on mobile browser or the gmail android app or iphone app. And let's not talk about Outlook as this nicely designed Microsoft product seems to remain the most problematic. Take outlook for web and outlook for desktop, while the web app completely accepts HTML and css, this is not entirely true for the desktop app as it operates on the VML language. 

So far, we only spoke about difficulties in email clients, however emails in general are still a bit of an old school and the HTML code to be used for perfectly looking email requires one to understand the fundamentals of fonts and tables.

For such reason, I wanted to come up with a CMS thats is meant for emails and call it EMS, email management system.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The EMS takes any email design template that you provide and breaks it into multiple reusable components. Then, when a user selects the template with which they like to proceed the system procceds to the working theatre where several components are represented by small thumbnails showing the structure and content of every component. When the component thumbnail is clicked the component is loaded to the board and the mapped form is loaded on the right side. Here the user can add their content for the particular campagn that they wish to send to their clients.

The user can create boilerplates, that is components that contain custom content that the user would like to use throughout multiple campaigns. for example, the social links are very commonly found in many emails and therefore, through a puzzle button on the left side of the theatre, the user can activate a second side menu and click on the tags that represent the component they wish to usein their current campaign.
